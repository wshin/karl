"""Karl's own identity facts, settable by its creator (birthday, birthplace, …).

These OVERRIDE the built-in canned identity answers — so when the user teaches Karl a
fact about itself ("you were born on June 20th, 2026"), the age/birthplace handlers
report that instead of the default. Persisted to config.SELF_FACTS_PATH (gitignored,
user-customized state) — kept separate from the user-fact memory store, which is for
facts about the USER, not about Karl.
