The scan is read-only: it flags senders with many unread emails and records them
to config.SPAM_LOG_PATH. NOTHING is deleted here — the user reviews and confirms
each sender through the spam-cleanup flow. The in-app scanner (started from
main()) runs every config.SPAM_SCAN_INTERVAL seconds (default 6 hours) while Karl
