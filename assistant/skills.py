"""Skills — Markdown playbooks injected into a turn when relevant.

A skill is a vetted Markdown file with simple frontmatter:

    ---
    name: arxiv-summarizer
    description: Find and summarize recent papers from arXiv on a topic.
    triggers: arxiv, \\bpaper(s)?\\b, preprint
    ---
    <step-by-step instructions, in Markdown, for doing the task>

This mirrors OpenClaw / Anthropic "Agent Skills": skills are PROSE, not code, so
they are model-agnostic and portable. The trade-off is that a skill only works
through tools Karl already has (read_file, write_file, list_dir, run_command,
web_search, fetch_url) — it can't conjure new capabilities, and it never bypasses
the run_command approval gate. Skills are committed, vetted files; they are NOT
auto-installed from any registry (that would be an untrusted-instruction / RCE
vector — see the discussion that motivated this module).

A skill is matched to a turn when any of its `triggers` (case-insensitive regex,
comma-separated) matches the user's message. Matched skills are folded into the
turn as a playbook block, the same way recalled memories are.
